# memorizer

A simple quick and simple Flutter project for a BYU Rel225 project. Also an attempt to learn mobile development with Flutter and Dart.

The basic idea is to make a simple app for memorizing quotes along with their sources.

## Plans
- [x] Add a view for viewing the full quote
- [x] Add a way to mark a quote as memorized or not
- [x] Remove ShortText attribute
- [x] Add more permanent storage (json, yaml...)
- [x] Add a view to add a new quote
- [x] Add minimum number of quotes
 
## Potential future improvements
- Add a search bar to search by reference, title or text
- Could add a feature where it blanks out random words to help the user memorize the quote
- Add support for multiple lists for different categories
- Improve pasting ability in the "Add Quote" view
