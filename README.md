# memorizer

A simple Flutter project for BYU Rel225. Also an attempt to learn mobile development with Flutter.

The basic idea is to make a simple app for memorizing quotes along with their sources.

## Plans
- Add a view for viewing the full quote
- Add a way to mark a quote as memorized or not
- Add a view to add a new quote

## Potential future improvements
- Add a search bar to search by reference, title or text
- Could add a feature where it blanks out random words to help the user memorize the quote
- Move the quotes to a database or file of some kind. This will allow preserving added quotes accross restart. Could look into a json file or sqflite.
